Game Engine Development
==================

# Current State
![Concept Screenshot](ConceptScreenshot.png)

This GIT hub project is my way of getting familiar with game development techniques used in many modern day games. I chose 
to first focus on 2D development since this would provide me with a nice starting point to focus on all the while being
able to apply advanced techniques like making use of shaders.

I decided to make use of XNA becauase i feel i am very compitent as a C# developer but still have a lot to learn with C++.
XNA also allows me to concentrate on the actual game development rather than lower level programing details. In the future
i could possibly take this code and try make it run on the cross-platform implementation of XNA - MonoGame.

Because my main focus of this project was to gain some insight into the technical details about how games tick, i chose
to develop the Game Engine from scratch rather than make use of XNA Game Engines like [Flat Red Ball](http://flatredball.com/)
I found this to be the right choice for me as a developer and i have learnt a lot from this.

Assets
------

All my artistic Assets come from the fantastic website [OpenGameArt.org](http://opengameart.org/). In particular, i am making use of
Assets that were made for the [Liberated Pixel](http://lpc.opengameart.org/) Cup challenge that was being organised by the same site.

I may attempt to design/draw some pixel art myself in the future, but currently i have decided to focus on development 
rather than creative design.
