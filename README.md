ShadowKillGame
==================

![Concept Screenshot](ConceptScreenshot.png)

Originally started off as development for an open source game by the name of DivineRight. The engine was built initially for this
purpose, but i quickly lost track with excitement and added completely awesome (but un-needed) features. For this reason,
i branched off from that development team and began development on my own cocnept game engine. This could possibly change
into a full blown game in the future.

A SandBox for developing a game Idea in XNA (C#). The code is meant to provide a very strong and steady code base which will yield
high performance and frame rates even with a large number of objects on the map.

Currently, the Engine is built to run 2D environments using a float-coordinate tile system which provides a lot of
flexibility in terms of designing world maps. Alot of testing and concept ideas are being developed at the moment,
such as the use of Animation frameworks, AI frameworks etc...

For future plans, the GameEngine could be extended to run in 2.5D i.e. a 3D engine but with 2D characteristics (Much
like the recent Pokemon games). Once the game engine framework is seen to be powerful/extensive enough, i shall 
probably begin desigining the game scope and actual gameplay itself.
