WorldMap
  - Contains reference to a long term storage file of the generated world map containing a number of tiles
  - generated world map could possibly be a result of procedural generation
  - What is displayed on the users screen would be a cubic subset of what the world map would contain
  - n x m tiles + Some form of buffer space (probably double) to allow smooth transitioning of lazy loading
	- This way, we can use a jagged array for what is being displayed on the map
	- A pointer can then be used to specify at which start point the array is being displayed
	- old content being removed will then simply be overwritten by what is being newly loaded (Similiar to the snake concept)
  - Need some way to be able to quickly identify points in the file which need to be read. CSV quick access?
  - Need to determine speed at which game would run. I.e. if the user can move at a speed of 1 tile/per move, if its 
    more action oriented etc...
